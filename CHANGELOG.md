<ul>
<li>Deleted a third project where I could not get the code
displayed to us during class, working.</li>
<li>I created a new project, and began building the server
for it, making separate classes for the server elements.</li>
<li>When I added the SQL database, and added some entries, I
began having issues. Tomorrow I will fix the issues, and 
get back to catching up on classwork.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I had to combine each class into the App class.</li>
<li>I had to comment-out the 2nd table declarations and 
insert statements for the project to run, but it does.
I added the third and 4th text boxes to the index.html page.
and added their functionality.</li>
<li>I added the functionality to have user-input add to the
in-memory SQL database.</li>
<li>I created a new repo on GitHub, deleted the others,
and pushed the project for my partner to look over.</li>
<li>Collaborated with partner to decide on the fields
of the JSON script we are using for the cards.
Changed background and text color of server page.</li>

<ul>

```
<ul>
<li>Fixed the SQL issues we were having by reordering the Create Table statements and the 
Insert Into statements. The order of operations is what was causing the issues there.</li>
<li>We added a few more cards to the in-memory rows to our database.</li>
<li>Created the addCard.html file to be the old index.html, and remade the index.html to be 
our landing page, and show a menu for the users.</li>
<li>After adding the remaining fields we wanted to add for each card, I displayed the 
in-memory cards on the addCard.html page.</li>
<li>Uploaded an icon to my Web site that was giving us issues displaying on different computers.</li>
</ul>
